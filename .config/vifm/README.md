# vifm

[`vifm`](https://vifm.info/) is a file manager with curses interface, which provides Vim-like environment for managing objects within file systems, extended with some useful ideas from mutt.
If you use vi, Vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands.

Vifm should have been installed from the `Brewfile`. Make sure by running `vifm` from your terminal. Try navigating around with regular `vim` navigations.
