# Karabiner

[`karabiner`](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is a keyboard customiser for macOS.

I use it for the following things:

- Set `fn` to `HYPER` (`Command` + `Option` + `Control` + `Shift`), which is used as a system-wide additional hotkey
- Set `caps_lock` to `option`, which is necessary since my keyboard customisation relies on option for accessing special (coding-relevant) characters

These two configurations should be automatically loaded from the configs + karabiner should be installed from the `Brewfile`.
